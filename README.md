We developed a website that demonstrates the challenges/risks in space travel that astronauts face during their missions in space. 
The website contains info about the physical and mental problems in a user-friendly way in order to teach people about space travel. 
In addition, our website also contains a game with our superhero “Supremo” as the main character, this game is just for users to try out and have fun! 
Our superhero “Supremo” is a fictional organism that can over-come most of the challenges that astronauts face in space! 
Our website provides useful and informative information about space travel in an easy and user-friendly way!

Our project is an informative website for people to view and learn more about the challenges of space travel in an easy and fun way, our website also contains a fun game featuring our superhero that is fun to play. 
Website viewers firstly land in our homepage which they can then navigate to three other pages “Mental Risks”, “Physical Risks” and, “Superhero”.

The “Mental Risks” page provides information about all the risks that can happen to an astronaut in space during his mission. 
The “Physical Risks” page provides useful information about the physical and tangible risks that can happen to an astronaut either in space or after returning to Earth. Finally, the “Superhero” page show our fictional superhero Supremo!
This page contains info about Supremo and his special characteristics and how he can overcome most of the risks in space. It also contains a fun game that viewers can play easily.

We believe that our website is an easy way for people to get guaranteed info about space travel in a fun way! We hope to help spread awareness about the risks of space travel, we also aim to show what astronauts go through during their missions.
We developed our website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and used Github for version control throughout our coding journey. We also used Figma for the website UI design.
